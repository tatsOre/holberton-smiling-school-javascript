# Holberton Smiling School - JavaScript

In this project, I finalized the previous project [0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap](https://github.com/tatsOre/holberton-smiling-school) and make some parts dynamic with Javascript (JQuery exactly).

The objective was simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.

#### Final result for desktop, tablet and mobile versions:

This webpage has been designed by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer.
